# Short links with [bitly](https://bit.ly/) in the console  
  
This is a console utility for shortening links using [bit.ly API](https://dev.bitly.com/). Using an existing bitly link, you can get count of clicks for all the time.  
  
## Getting Started  
  
You need to create a Bitly account [bitly](https://bit.ly/) and get a GENERIC ACCESS TOKEN.  
  
## How to run  
  
Download the project and create a .env file. Create a 'BITLY_TOKEN' variable in this file, which will store your bitly token.  
A sample `.env` file might look like this:
```
BITLY_TOKEN=<your token>
```

  
### Requirements  

Python3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:  

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  
### Shorten your first link!  

Run at the command prompt  
```
python main.py <link>
```
Usage example:
```
python main.py https://www.google.com/
```
  
You need to enter a link. A successful response will return the shortened link in the link object.  
If you enter an existing bit ly link, the result will be the number of clicks for the entire time.
